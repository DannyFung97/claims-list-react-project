# Claims List React Project

The Claims List React Project is a web app that stores newly created claims and also allows the user to check off claims while confirming or denying their validities.

## About

This project aims to iterate a portion of a previous project that I've worked on with a different web stack. I also consider this project an exercise that allowed me to experiment with tools and methods I never used before such as MongoDB, Redux, and an improved folder structure.

## Technologies so far

MongoDB, Express, React, Redux, Node

## Installation and Preparation

Be sure to install MongoDB locally since this web app uses this database to modify data. The database's name should be "test1" and the collection is "claims".
