# Claims List React Project

The Claims List React Project is a web app that stores newly created claims and also allows the user to check off claims while confirming or denying their validities.

## About

This project aims to iterate a portion of a previous project that I've worked on with a different web stack.

## Technologies so far

MongoDB, Express, React, Node

## Installation and Preparation

Be sure to install MongoDB locally since this web app uses this database to modify data. The database's name should be "test1" and the collection is "claims".

```
npm install
cd frontend/
npm install
cd ../backend/
npm install
```

## Usage

```
npm run dev
```
